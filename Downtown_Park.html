                        <p><h3>Park amenities:</h3>
                            <li><h4>Info:</h4>Bellevue Downtown Park is a 21-acre oasis of green in the heart of Bellevue. A one-half mile promenade, bordered by a double row of shade trees, and a stepped canal, brings one to the 240-foot wide waterfall that cascades into a reflecting pond. A ten-acre lawn area invites one to pause for a picnic with Bellevue’s skyline and Mount Rainier in the background. The park’s delightful play area and formal gardens add to family enjoyment and serve as a backdrop for community events.</li>              
                            <li><h4>Playground:</h4>The playground is open year-round, and typically sprays water from the Friday of Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day.  The playground provides for year-round enjoyment with or without spraying water</li>
                            <li><h4>Parking:</h4>There are two parking lots for the Downtown Park.  Both are within close proximity to the Playground:
                                    Th main lotis on 100th Avenue NE, and the entry is close to the mid-block of 100th between NE 4th Street and NE 1st Street.
                                    The secondary lot is on NE 1st Street close to the intersection of NE 1st and 100th Avenue NE.  This lot is immediately adjacent to the playground.
